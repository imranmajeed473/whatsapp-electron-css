# Step 5 â€” Building Your First Application
# install the electron-builder CLI tools globally
npm install -g electron-builder

# verify the success of it by running the following command in your terminal
electron-builder --version

# Now you can build your first cross-platform application. To do this open your terminal and run the following command in your project directory:
electron-builder -mwl

# Build applications for Windows:
electron-builder --win


# Your project directory creates a new folder called dist. All your built applications and unzip versions of the application are located in that folder.
cd dist
